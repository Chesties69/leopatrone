## gallery decisions
- do we want a scrolly gallery? or a javascript gallery?
- horizontal or vertical?
- do we want one pic at a time visible? or posibly multiple based on aspect rations of neighboring photos?
- do we want each photo to take up the most space possible? or do we want all photos to keep the same visual surface area?
- keep in mind both mobile and desktop
